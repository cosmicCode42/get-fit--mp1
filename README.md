# Milestone Project 1 - Get Fit

A static 3-page website built as my milestone project for the Introduction to Web Development course provided by Code Institute.

## UX

External userâ€™s goal:
- The site's users are gym members and potential members, who want to know more about the gym and its procedures.

Site owner's goal:
- The gym is interested in attracting and retaining members.

Potential features to include:
- Showcase photos of people having fun exercising in the gym and any other media to motivate people to come.
- Provide detail on the organised classes in the gym and their schedule.
- Provide information on the gym's location, opening hours, contact details and any external resources.
